# gittr.space - 30 Second Elevator Pitch

## The Pitch

**"Imagine if GitHub never went down, your code lived forever, and you owned it completely. That's gittr.space."**

We're building the first truly decentralized Git hosting platform on Nostr—the same protocol powering the censorship-resistant social network. When GitHub had those outages last month, thousands of developers couldn't push and users ccode. With gittr, your repositories live on a distributed network of relays. Even if one goes down, your code is still accessible.

**Here's what makes us different:**

- **Self-sovereign hosting**: You own your repos, not a corporation. Your code lives in the "Nostr cloud"—a distributed network where data persists across thousands of nodes.

- **Built for the open source community**: We're not a company seeking VC funding. We're part of the Nostr ecosystem, built by developers, for developers. Every contribution strengthens the network.

- **Self-hostable**: Like Git itself, you can run gittr yourself. Deploy your own bridge, run your own relay, or use the hosted version—your choice. The code is open source, so you're never locked in.

- **Feature-rich platform**: Unlike other Nostr Git clients that are CLI-focused and lack proper authentication, gittr brings a full-featured web platform. We combine all sources—GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, and the Nostr cloud—into one unified experience with proper key management, web UI, and collaboration tools.

- **GRASP network participation**: Repositories sync across multiple git servers automatically. Clone from any GRASP-compatible server—redundancy built-in.

- **Future monetization**: We're planning a marketplace where developers can sell software packages and premium repositories directly, with Bitcoin Lightning payments. No middleman, no platform fees.

- **Censorship-resistant**: Unlike centralized platforms, no one can take down your code. It's stored across the Nostr network, making it resilient to takedowns or outages.

**The Nostr community is growing fast—hundreds of thousands of users already. We're bringing Git to that ecosystem, creating the infrastructure for the next generation of open source development.**

- **Developer Tools**: Build CLI tools, IDE plugins, and integrations with other platforms

### Differentiation
- **vs GitHub**: Decentralized, never goes down, you own your data
- **vs GitLab**: No single point of failure, censorship-resistant
- **vs Codeberg**: Built on Nostr protocol, integrated with Lightning payments, automatic network backup
- **vs other Nostr Git clients**: 
  - Most are CLI-focused with limited or no authentication
  - gittr provides a full-featured web platform with proper key management
  - Combines all sources (GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, Nostr cloud) into one unified experience
  - Web UI with collaboration tools, issue tracking, PRs, and bounties
- **vs self-hosted Git server**: 
  - No server management—your repos are automatically backed up across the Nostr network
  - No single point of failure—if your server dies, your code lives on
  - No maintenance burden—relays handle the infrastructure
  - Automatic redundancy—repos sync across multiple GRASP servers
  - Built-in discoverability—your repos are part of a global network
  - Lightning payments built-in—no need to set up payment infrastructure
  - **But you CAN self-host**: Unlike GitHub/GitLab, you can run gittr yourself if you want—the code is open source and self-hostable

## 30-Second Version (Fast)

**"gittr.space is decentralized Git hosting on Nostr. When GitHub goes down, your code doesn't. Your repositories live across thousands of relays—you own them, they're backed up automatically, and they can't be censored. Unlike other Nostr Git clients that are CLI-focused and lack proper authentication, gittr brings a feature-rich web platform that combines all sources—GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, and the Nostr cloud—into one unified experience. Unlike running your own Git server, there's no maintenance—the network handles redundancy. Unlike Codeberg, your repos are part of a global distributed network with built-in Lightning payments. Best of all, like Git itself, you can run gittr yourself—deploy your own bridge, use the hosted version, or both. Currently maintained by two developers, we're building the infrastructure for self-sovereign software development, with a future marketplace for paid repos and packages. We're seeking support to grow the team, scale infrastructure, and accelerate development. It's open source, part of the Nostr community, and ready for the next generation of developers who want true ownership without the server management headache."**

## 60-Second Version (Detailed)

**"gittr.space is the first truly decentralized Git hosting platform built on Nostr—the same protocol that's powering censorship-resistant social networking. Think of it as GitHub, but your code lives forever across a distributed network of relays, not on a single company's servers."**

**"When GitHub had those outages recently, thousands of developers were stuck. With gittr, even if one relay goes down, your code is still accessible from dozens of others. It's self-sovereign hosting—you own your repositories completely, and they're automatically backed up in what we call the 'Nostr cloud.'"**

**"Why not just run your own Git server? Because you'd have to manage backups, deal with downtime, handle security updates, and maintain infrastructure. With gittr, the network handles all of that. Your repos are automatically replicated across multiple GRASP servers—no server management required. But here's the key difference: unlike GitHub or GitLab, you CAN run gittr yourself if you want. The code is open source and self-hostable. Deploy your own git-nostr-bridge, run your own relay, or use the hosted version—it's your choice. You're never locked in."**

**"Why not Codeberg? Codeberg is great, but it's still centralized. If Codeberg goes down or gets blocked, you're stuck. With gittr, your code exists across thousands of Nostr relays worldwide. Plus, we have built-in Lightning payments for bounties and future paid repos—no need to set up separate payment infrastructure."**

**"We're not a traditional company seeking VC funding. We're part of the open source Nostr community, building infrastructure for developers who want true ownership. We participate in the GRASP network, so repositories sync across multiple git servers automatically."**

**"What sets us apart from other Nostr Git clients? Most are CLI-focused tools with limited or no authentication. gittr is different—we've built a full-featured web platform with proper key management, collaboration tools, issue tracking, PRs, and bounties. We combine all sources—GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, and the Nostr cloud—into one unified experience. You get the power of Nostr with the convenience of a modern web platform."**

**"The future is exciting: we're planning a marketplace where developers can sell software packages and premium repositories directly, with Bitcoin Lightning payments—no middleman, no platform fees. The Nostr ecosystem is growing fast, and we're bringing Git to that network."**

**"Right now, gittr is maintained by two core developers. We've built something that works, but to scale and realize the full vision, we need support. Funding would help us grow the team, scale infrastructure, build advanced features, invest in security audits, and support the community. We're not looking for traditional VC investment—we want partners who understand open source infrastructure and the Nostr ecosystem."**

**"And here's what makes us different from other platforms: like Git itself, you can run gittr yourself. Deploy your own git-nostr-bridge, run your own relay, or use the hosted version at gittr.space. The code is completely open source—you're never locked in. Push to Nostr, run it yourself, or both. It's your choice."**

**"It's open source, censorship-resistant, and ready for developers who want to build without depending on a single corporation or managing their own infrastructure. Visit gittr.space to see it in action."**

## Investor-Friendly Version (Emphasizing Open Source)

**"gittr.space is an open source project building decentralized Git hosting on Nostr. We're not seeking traditional investment—we're part of the Nostr community, which values open source infrastructure over corporate ownership."**

**"However, we're building something that could transform how developers work: self-sovereign code hosting that never goes down, can't be censored, and gives developers true ownership. The Nostr network is growing rapidly, and we're positioned to be the Git layer of that ecosystem."**

**"Currently, gittr is maintained by two core developers. We've built a fully functional platform with active users, but to scale and realize the full vision, we need support. Funding would enable us to:"**

**"Grow the team—hire additional developers to accelerate feature development and maintain critical infrastructure. Scale our infrastructure—support more GRASP servers and relays as the userbase grows. Build out advanced features—the marketplace, paid repos, and collaboration tools. Invest in security—professional audits and penetration testing. Support the community—fund events, documentation, and developer outreach."**

**"Our future includes a marketplace for paid repositories and software packages, with Bitcoin Lightning payments. This creates a sustainable model for open source development while maintaining the decentralized, community-driven ethos."**

**"If you're interested in supporting open source infrastructure that empowers developers rather than locking them into platforms, gittr.space is worth exploring. We're building the future of code hosting, one commit at a time."**
