# gittr.space - 30 Second Elevator Pitch

## The Pitch

**"Imagine if GitHub never went down, your code lived forever, and you owned it completely. That's gittr.space."**

We're building the first truly decentralized Git hosting platform on Nostr—the same protocol powering the censorship-resistant social network. When GitHub had those outages last month, thousands of developers couldn't push and users ccode. With gittr, your repositories live on a distributed network of relays. Even if one goes down, your code is still accessible.

**Here's what makes us different:**

- **Self-sovereign hosting**: You own your repos, not a corporation. Your code lives in the "Nostr cloud"—a distributed network where data persists across thousands of nodes.

- **Built for the open source community**: We're not a company seeking VC funding. We're part of the Nostr ecosystem, built by developers, for developers. Every contribution strengthens the network.

- **GRASP network participation**: Repositories sync across multiple git servers automatically. Clone from any GRASP-compatible server—redundancy built-in.

- **Future monetization**: We're planning a marketplace where developers can sell software packages and premium repositories directly, with Bitcoin Lightning payments. No middleman, no platform fees.

- **Censorship-resistant**: Unlike centralized platforms, no one can take down your code. It's stored across the Nostr network, making it resilient to takedowns or outages.

**The Nostr community is growing fast—hundreds of thousands of users already. We're bringing Git to that ecosystem, creating the infrastructure for the next generation of open source development.**

## Key Talking Points (Expandable)

### Technical Highlights
- **NIP-34 compliant**: Works with any Nostr client
- **SSH & HTTPS support**: Standard Git commands work out of the box
- **Multi-source file fetching**: Automatically tries GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, and GRASP servers
- **Bitcoin Lightning integration**: Zaps, bounties, and future paid repos

### Community & Network Effects
- **Relay network**: Your repos are replicated across multiple Nostr relays
- **GRASP protocol**: Interoperable with other Nostr-based git servers
- **Growing userbase**: Part of the rapidly expanding Nostr ecosystem
- **Open source first**: All code is open source, community-driven development

### Business Model (Future)
- **Marketplace for paid repos**: Developers can monetize private repositories
- **Software package sales**: Sell installable packages directly
- **Bounty system**: Already live—fund issues with Bitcoin Lightning
- **No platform fees**: Direct peer-to-peer payments via Lightning

### Differentiation
- **vs GitHub**: Decentralized, never goes down, you own your data
- **vs GitLab**: No single point of failure, censorship-resistant
- **vs Codeberg**: Built on Nostr protocol, integrated with Lightning payments, automatic network backup
- **vs self-hosted Git server**: 
  - No server management—your repos are automatically backed up across the Nostr network
  - No single point of failure—if your server dies, your code lives on
  - No maintenance burden—relays handle the infrastructure
  - Automatic redundancy—repos sync across multiple GRASP servers
  - Built-in discoverability—your repos are part of a global network
  - Lightning payments built-in—no need to set up payment infrastructure

## 30-Second Version (Fast)

**"gittr.space is decentralized Git hosting on Nostr. When GitHub goes down, your code doesn't. Your repositories live across thousands of relays—you own them, they're backed up automatically, and they can't be censored. Unlike running your own Git server, there's no maintenance—the network handles redundancy. Unlike Codeberg, your repos are part of a global distributed network with built-in Lightning payments. We're building the infrastructure for self-sovereign software development, with a future marketplace for paid repos and packages. It's open source, part of the Nostr community, and ready for the next generation of developers who want true ownership without the server management headache."**

## 60-Second Version (Detailed)

**"gittr.space is the first truly decentralized Git hosting platform built on Nostr—the same protocol that's powering censorship-resistant social networking. Think of it as GitHub, but your code lives forever across a distributed network of relays, not on a single company's servers."**

**"When GitHub had those outages recently, thousands of developers were stuck. With gittr, even if one relay goes down, your code is still accessible from dozens of others. It's self-sovereign hosting—you own your repositories completely, and they're automatically backed up in what we call the 'Nostr cloud.'"**

**"Why not just run your own Git server? Because you'd have to manage backups, deal with downtime, handle security updates, and maintain infrastructure. With gittr, the network handles all of that. Your repos are automatically replicated across multiple GRASP servers—no server management required."**

**"Why not Codeberg? Codeberg is great, but it's still centralized. If Codeberg goes down or gets blocked, you're stuck. With gittr, your code exists across thousands of Nostr relays worldwide. Plus, we have built-in Lightning payments for bounties and future paid repos—no need to set up separate payment infrastructure."**

**"We're not a traditional company seeking VC funding. We're part of the open source Nostr community, building infrastructure for developers who want true ownership. We participate in the GRASP network, so repositories sync across multiple git servers automatically."**

**"The future is exciting: we're planning a marketplace where developers can sell software packages and premium repositories directly, with Bitcoin Lightning payments—no middleman, no platform fees. The Nostr ecosystem is growing fast, and we're bringing Git to that network."**

**"It's open source, censorship-resistant, and ready for developers who want to build without depending on a single corporation or managing their own infrastructure. Visit gittr.space to see it in action."**

## Investor-Friendly Version (Emphasizing Open Source)

**"gittr.space is an open source project building decentralized Git hosting on Nostr. We're not seeking traditional investment—we're part of the Nostr community, which values open source infrastructure over corporate ownership."**

**"However, we're building something that could transform how developers work: self-sovereign code hosting that never goes down, can't be censored, and gives developers true ownership. The Nostr network is growing rapidly, and we're positioned to be the Git layer of that ecosystem."**

**"Our future includes a marketplace for paid repositories and software packages, with Bitcoin Lightning payments. This creates a sustainable model for open source development while maintaining the decentralized, community-driven ethos."**

**"If you're interested in supporting open source infrastructure that empowers developers rather than locking them into platforms, gittr.space is worth exploring. We're building the future of code hosting, one commit at a time."**
